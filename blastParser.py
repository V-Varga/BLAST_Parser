Title: blastParser.py
Date: 2021-01-25
Authors: VirÃ¡g Varga

Description:
	This program parses BLASTp results and creates an output file containing selected
	 	categories of information for each query sequence.

List of functions:
	No functions are defined in this script.

List of standard and non-standard modules used:
	sys
	re

Procedure:
	1. Assigning command line arguments and output file name; loading modules.
	2. Creating a dictionary containing the pertinent results of the BLASTp file.
	3. Writing out the results to a file.

Known bugs and limitations:
	- This BLAST Parser is made specifically to suit the formatting of the NCBI BLASTp output files.
	- There is no quality-checking integrated into the code.

Usage
	./blastParser.py input_file output_file
	OR
	python blastParser.py input_file output_file

This script was written for Python 3.8.6, in Spyder 4.

#Part 2: Parse through the file to create dictionaries with the desired information
#Part 3: Write out the results to the output file
